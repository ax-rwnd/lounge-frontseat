#Lounge-frontseat
This is the front-end of the Lounge-o-matic project. In this part, we shall focus on the client-side programming.

Front-end development or client-side development provides a user-friendly interface 
that allows indirect manipulation of users or shared content.

The desired end result will be a dynamic website. This website should support states via sessions and/or cookies.
The front end needs to be able to handle history and support sending and receiving of binary data.
##Purpose
Educational purpose. 

###Tools for front-end development
Three common coding languages that are to be used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.   
Template engine: runs the server-side programming language and creates HTML/CSS/JS
output based on some parameters. Hence, dynamic.

###Compatibility
Javascript ensures the compability with the most popular browsers.
Useful for validating input, create "real-time" applications and update parts of a webpage.
